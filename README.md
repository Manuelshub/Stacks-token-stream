# Stacks-token-stream

A token streaming protocol is basically a way of establishing a continuous payment stream between two parties - a sender and a recipient. The sender starts by creating a stream that defines the time period, the amount of tokens to pay per-block to the recipient, and who the recipient is. The recipient can then, at his will, withdraw whatever he is owed at any point up until the end of the time period.
